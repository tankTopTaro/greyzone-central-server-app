Day 1
I just setup a MySQL server. I generated some random data for now. I need to get some clarification regarding the data for game_session (date_add, duration_s_theory, duration_s_actual, parent_gs_id)

I need to review the document again.

Day 2
Created some API routes for the CSA. I need to create the GFA next to simulate the POST methods of the API. I need to ask about the data for the game_session by tomorrow. Setting up the raspberry pi can wait until my card reader arrive.
